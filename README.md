Introduction to unpacking using r2
=======

This repository contains the slides and samples used for the 
[r2con 2017](http://radare.org/con/2017/) 5 hour training.

The idea of the training was to go through different malware samples and
explain several approaches one could take to unpack them, focusing on different
strategies instead of focusing only on the specific steps.

The training was completely hands-on therefore the workflow was to let the
attendees attempt each sample and slowly but surely (each N minutes) advance
one slide at a time showing them one more clue about how to unpack the sample.

Feel free to use these slides for your own trainings, but let us know so we can
feel even prouder of our work!
